# Custom-Dictionary

USEFUL for STORING multiple meanings of a term and EVEN your interpretation of that term i.e. the meaning of the term in YOUR WORDS. Hence creating a Custom-Dictionary, Your Dictionary.

The HTML, Javascript files are bascially to be used to create an ionic app (say using something like Apache Cordova), but can also be used as a website. The app functions like a custom dictionary, with it you can add terms(words) and their corresponding meanings which you see fit, i.e. the meanings you find useful (since a word can have multiple, possibly unrelated, meanings). You can add words and search for their meanings from different sources (the main source being Investopedia at the moment) and add multiple meanings for the same word. You can "star" words, look up  the words that you've already searched before. Uses the localstorage provided by HTML5 for storing the terms(words) and their meanings.

Please note that I created this project just after I learned Javascript and creating cross-platform apps using Apache Cordova. I was naive back then. After I got the project to do what I wanted it to do, I kinda abandoned it and did not make any improvements later (it definitely needs some).
