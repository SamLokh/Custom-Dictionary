                //Or we can disbale it and keep a button which will clear the above textbox and then ask the user to add another word whose meaning is to be searched.
    
    
    // Case : What if the word that the user wants to search the meaning for does not exist? Add a prompt and redirect to page 2.
    
            
                // debate : textarea editable  or not?
                // I think it should be editable and if edited, the user should be prompted like : "Hey, you just edited the meaning, do you want to save the changes? y/n?" like MS Word does.
